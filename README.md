# Netcode

Implementing a multiplayer game for my thesis work. This project was mostly a way for me to learn DirectX 12 and graphics related questions. All while exploring the mysteries of a network protocol development.

# Build

I'm planning to overhaul the dependency handling so I can start using a CI system. Until then, building this manually will be a pain, as I'm using a lot of 3rd party libraries.
