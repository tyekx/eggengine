<h2>About the website</h2>

<p>This website was written in a few languages, you can split it into 2 parts, frontend and a backend. The split is pretty self explanatory, I needed to create multiple clients for the same interface. Which screams to make a web API and use that to communicate.</p>

<p>I chose JSON as a way of communicating, some token and cookie handling to handle log-ins or already logged in users</p>

<p>The human interface, the one you can click around on was written in JavaScript using probably my favorite ever framework, AngularJS 1.7.2. I tried tinkering around with the newest of Angular, seeing that it compiled to 170 mbytes of code I ditched the idea. Aside from JavaScript I needed to use some HTML and CSS for the looks.</p>

<p>The not so human interface, was rewritten in many frameworks as I was testing some, my favorite the old Laravel 4.2 was not working anymore, the new Laravel felt too huge for this project. The Phalcon I could not really be satisfied with. So I settled with a seemingly small Database wrapper Medoo, and some vanilla PHP. Again, most of the frameworks were designed for something bigger. I just wanted a cleaner way to use my MySQL database because that can be ugly.</p>

<h2>The client</h2>

<p>Started out as a fun little directx12 adventure, ended up begin something partially real. I tried to implement a ton of stuff, while learning them as i progressed. I watched a lot of GDC talks and how big companies build their engines, naturally I couldn't build that size, but one can try amiright.</p>

<h2>About the server code</h2>

<p>For the client, I wrote a library for myself, with the server, I tried reusing and extending said library, so that the codebase are shared as much as possible.</p>

<p>This project taught me a lot, especially how hard it is to actually time computer programs without using any busy-cycle. Or how hard it is to keep a consistent frame of the users. Doing what when can be super complex and honestly there is no best solution here. My approach is to be as fair as possible, meaning that every player gets the same treatment</p>
